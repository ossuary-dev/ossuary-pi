# SSH-Safe Installation Implementation

## Overview
The new installer is designed to handle SSH disconnections gracefully, ensuring installation completes even if the connection drops.

## How It Works

### SSH Detection
```bash
if [ -n "$SSH_CLIENT" ] || [ -n "$SSH_TTY" ]; then
    # SSH session detected
fi
```

### Background Execution Strategy

1. **Creates wrapper script** at `/tmp/ossuary-install-wrapped.sh`
2. **Runs with nohup** to survive terminal disconnection
3. **Logs everything** to `/tmp/ossuary-install.log`
4. **Auto-reboots** after successful completion
5. **Monitors progress** while connection exists

### Key Safety Features

#### 1. Background Process
```bash
nohup bash "$script_path" > /tmp/ossuary-install-output.log 2>&1 &
```
- Detached from terminal
- Continues even if SSH dies
- All output logged

#### 2. Progress Monitoring
- Shows PID for manual checking
- Displays progress dots while connected
- Can tail log file: `tail -f /tmp/ossuary-install.log`

#### 3. Automatic Reboot
```bash
(sleep 10 && reboot) &
```
- Schedules reboot after completion
- Gives time to see success message
- Ensures clean state after install

#### 4. Completion Marker
```bash
touch /tmp/ossuary-install-complete
```
- Creates file when done
- Allows script to verify success
- Survives even if main process dies

### User Experience

#### What User Sees (SSH)
```

         SSH SESSION DETECTED - IMPORTANT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This installation will:
  1. Disable dhcpcd and enable NetworkManager
  2. Install WiFi Connect and dependencies
  3. Configure services
  4. REBOOT YOUR SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY

Your SSH connection WILL be disconnected.

The installation will continue even if SSH disconnects.
The system will automatically reboot when complete.

After reboot:
  • Look for 'Ossuary-Setup' WiFi network if no WiFi found
  • Or SSH back in using the same IP address

Do you want to continue? (yes/no): yes

Starting SSH-safe installation...
Installation will continue in background even if this session disconnects.

Installation running in background (PID: 12345)
You can monitor progress with: tail -f /tmp/ossuary-install.log
Installation is running...
.....Installation completed successfully!
System will reboot in 10 seconds...
```

#### If SSH Disconnects
- Installation continues in background
- System reboots automatically
- User can SSH back after reboot
- Or connect to AP if no WiFi

### Local Installation
For local/physical access, installation runs normally without background process:
- Real-time output
- No automatic reboot
- Services start immediately

## Logging

All operations logged to `/tmp/ossuary-install.log`:
```
[2024-10-23 16:45:00] Starting SSH-safe installation...
[2024-10-23 16:45:01] Installing dependencies...
[2024-10-23 16:45:30] Installing Balena WiFi Connect...
[2024-10-23 16:46:00] WiFi Connect installed successfully
[2024-10-23 16:46:05] Installation completed successfully!
[2024-10-23 16:46:05] Rebooting in 10 seconds...
```

## Recovery

If installation fails or SSH disconnects:

1. **Check if still running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep ossuary-install
   ```

2. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/ossuary-install.log
   ```

3. **Check completion:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /tmp/ossuary-install-complete
   ```

4. **Manual completion:**
   If mostly done, just reboot:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

## Uninstaller Safety

The uninstaller is also SSH-aware:
- Warns about network changes
- Preserves connection when possible
- Doesn't auto-reboot
- Allows config preservation

## Testing Instructions

### Test SSH Safety
1. SSH into Pi
2. Run: `sudo ./install.sh`
3. Confirm with "yes"
4. Disconnect SSH (close terminal)
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Try to SSH back in
7. Verify installation completed

### Test Progress Monitoring
1. SSH into Pi
2. Run: `sudo ./install.sh`
3. In another terminal: `tail -f /tmp/ossuary-install.log`
4. Watch both outputs
5. Verify completion

### Test Local Installation
1. Connect monitor/keyboard
2. Run: `sudo ./install.sh`
3. Verify real-time output
4. Verify no auto-reboot

## Why This Approach Works

1. **nohup** - Immune to HUP signal when terminal closes
2. **Background process** - Not tied to SSH session
3. **File-based logging** - Persistent record of progress
4. **Completion marker** - Clear success indicator
5. **Auto-reboot** - Clean state guaranteed

This ensures users never end up with a half-installed system or permanently lost SSH access.
