# Ossuary Pi - Executive Summary

## Project Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY

## Overview
Ossuary Pi attempts to create a WiFi failover system with captive portal for Raspberry Pi. When WiFi connection is lost, it should automatically create an access point with a web interface for reconfiguration. However, the current implementation has critical architectural flaws that make it unreliable and dangerous to deploy.

## Key Findings

### Architecture Problems
1. **Relies on git submodule** (raspi-captive-portal) that may fail to initialize
2. **Python service embedded as string** in bash install script (poor practice)
3. **No separation of concerns** - everything mixed together
4. **Multiple "fix" scripts** indicate core functionality is broken

### Critical Safety Issues
1. **Can disconnect SSH permanently** during installation
2. **No rollback mechanism** if installation fails
3. **Modifies system files** without backups
4. **Runs everything as root** (security risk)

### Functionality Issues
1. **AP mode often fails to start** when WiFi is lost
2. **WiFi reconnection unreliable** after using captive portal
3. **Startup commands fail silently** without clear errors
4. **Hard-coded to wlan0** - fails on systems with different interface names

## What Works (Sometimes)
- Basic installation completes (if not over SSH)
- Flask web interface loads (when services are running)
- WiFi scanning functionality
- Manual AP mode activation (with fix scripts)

## What Doesn't Work Reliably
- SSH installation (high risk of disconnection)
- Automatic AP mode activation on WiFi failure
- WiFi reconnection after configuration
- Startup command execution
- Service recovery after failures

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (If You Must Use This)
1. **Never install over SSH** - physical access required
2. **Backup your system first** - installation can break networking
3. **Expect manual fixes** - keep fix scripts handy
4. **Test thoroughly** before deploying

### Proper Solution
**Complete rewrite using proven solutions:**

1. **RaspAP + Nodogsplash** (Recommended)
   - Mature, actively maintained
   - Professional web interface
   - Proven reliability

2. **Balena WiFi Connect**
   - Purpose-built for this use case
   - Modern architecture (Rust)
   - Automatic failover designed in

3. **Custom with NetworkManager**
   - Use standard Pi OS tools
   - Proper service architecture
   - No submodule dependencies

## Files Cleaned Up
Removed unnecessary debug/fix scripts:
- fix-ap-service.sh
- fix-captive-portal.sh
- force-ap-mode.sh
- test-ap-mode.sh
- debug-startup.sh
- diagnose-captive-portal.sh
- verify-install.sh
- captive-portal/.vscode/

## Risk Assessment
- **Installation Risk:** HIGH - Can lose remote access
- **Security Risk:** MEDIUM - Open WiFi, root services
- **Reliability Risk:** HIGH - Multiple failure points
- **Maintenance Risk:** SEVERE - Poor architecture

## Success Probability
- Clean installation: 60%
- Working as advertised: 20%
- Long-term reliability: 10%

## Time Investment
- Initial setup: 2-4 hours (with troubleshooting)
- Ongoing maintenance: High
- User support: Significant

## Final Verdict

**This codebase is not suitable for production use.** It has fundamental architectural flaws, safety issues, and reliability problems. The presence of multiple "fix" scripts is a clear indicator that even basic functionality doesn't work properly.

**Recommendation:** Use RaspAP or Balena WiFi Connect instead. These are proven, maintained solutions that will save significant time and frustration.
